## HANDOFF-2025-09-28-2000 (Streaming Hardening)

### Session Duration: ~90 minutes
### Branch: main
### Phase: Streaming hardening & documentation alignment

### Completed:
- [done] Hardened pipe streaming in `ShellAdapterV2` with concurrent stdin/stdout handling and ASCII fallback messaging.
- [done] Added streaming capability metadata and updated CLI help to describe pipe prerequisites.
- [done] Documented recipient/identity workflows, streaming strategy selection, and `cage.toml` editing guidance (README, docs/LIBRARY_USAGE.md).
- [done] Added pipe streaming regression coverage and executed `cargo test --lib test_shell_adapter_v2_pipe_stream_round_trip`.

### Findings:
- [todo] Large-file benchmarking for pipe streaming still outstanding; only unit-level validation exists today.
- [todo] CLI help output retains emoji-heavy headers; broader SEC-01 ASCII migration remains.
- [todo] No built-in helper for editing `cage.toml` beyond documented manual steps (CAGE-06 follow-up).

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Validate pipe streaming under large-file load and capture performance notes (CAGE-12a follow-up).
2. Continue SEC-01 cleanup on CLI surfaces by replacing remaining emoji/glyph output.
3. Design or stub a helper command for viewing/editing `cage.toml` (CAGE-06 follow-up).

### Context Hash: (pending commit)
### Files Modified: 6 (`src/cage/adapter_v2.rs`, `src/cage/strings.rs`, `src/bin/cli_age.rs`, `README.md`, `docs/LIBRARY_USAGE.md`, `docs/procs/TASKS.txt`)

## HANDOFF-2025-09-27-1800

### Session Duration: ~45 minutes
### Branch: main
### Phase: Validation & backlog reconciliation

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Verified BUG-01/02/03/05 landed in `CrudManager` & proxy pipeline (extension suffix, recursion, globbing, PTY proxy).
- ‚úÖ Documented outstanding work in TASKS/PROCESS/QUICK_REF (selective unlock, backup retention, config loader, recipient/identity backlog).
- ‚úÖ Added CAGE-10 ticket for identity-key support and adjusted priority queue.

### Findings:
- üü° BUG-04 still missing selective unlock implementation/tests (`src/cage/lifecycle/crud_manager.rs:1004`).
- üü° Backup pipeline lacks retention/conflict handling despite existing `backup_before_lock` work.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Core CLI only supports passphrase operations; multi-recipient and identity flows remain proxy-only.

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Implement selective unlock logic + regression tests (BUG-04).
2. Design backup retention/conflict handling (CAGE-03 follow-up).
3. Prototype config file discovery/loading (CAGE-06) to unblock recipient/identity features.

### Context Hash: (pending commit)
### Files Modified: 4 (docs/procs/TASKS.txt, PROCESS.txt, QUICK_REF.txt, CONTINUE.md)

## HANDOFF-2025-09-28-? (UAT/dev sync)

### Session Duration: ~1 hour
### Branch: main
### Phase: Request/API integration & adapter groundwork

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ BUG-04 follow-up finalized: selective unlock logging now routed through glyph helpers (`fmt_warning` etc.).
- ‚úÖ CAGE-11 wiring: CLI uses `lock_with_request` / `unlock_with_request`; tests confirm request builders.
- ‚úÖ TEST-04 gating: selective-unlock tests skip gracefully when `age` binary missing.
- ‚úÖ AdapterFactory now returns `AdapterV1Compat<ShellAdapterV2>` to expose the new trait surface.
- ‚úÖ ShellAdapterV2 supports passphrase streaming plus recipient-based encryption and identity-file decryption flows.
- ‚úÖ CLI lock/unlock accept identity & recipient flags, routing through new request APIs.
- ‚úÖ Optional streaming strategies exposed via `CAGE_STREAMING_STRATEGY` (temp vs pipe fallback).
- ‚úÖ Backup retention now enforced via AgeConfig (default + configurable directory).
- ‚úÖ AgeConfig loads from standard config paths (TOML) with backup/streaming settings.

### Partial:
- üü° CAGE-12: Streaming implemented for passphrase + basic recipients/identity files; pipe strategy needs capability reporting & perf validation.

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Harden pipe-based streaming (capability reporting, perf validation) and document strategy selection (CAGE-12/12a).
2. Document new CLI identity/recipient/streaming options (README/help) and expose config workflow (CAGE-06 follow-up).
3. Continue SEC-01 string migration, replacing emoji/glyph output with ASCII-only strings.

### Files Modified: CODEX_START.txt, docs/procs/{TASKS,PROCESS,QUICK_REF}.txt, src/bin/cli_age.rs, src/cage/{adapter.rs,adapter_v2.rs,in_place.rs,mod.rs,progress/{core.rs,mod.rs},requests.rs,strings.rs}, tests/test_selective_unlock.rs
