     # Continue Log – Bug Slate Progress

## HANDOFF-2025-10-01 (MOD4-02 PTY Consolidation) ✅

### Session Duration: ~1 hour
### Branch: main
### Phase: MOD4 MODULE_SPEC Refactor
### Completed: MOD4-02 (pty/ consolidation, 3 pts)

### Consolidation Details:
- Created `src/cage/pty/` module with `mod.rs`, `tty.rs`, `wrap.rs`
- Moved `tty_automation.rs` → `pty/tty.rs`, `pty_wrap.rs` → `pty/wrap.rs`
- Updated all imports across 7 files (all pty_wrap/tty_automation → pty)
- All tests passing (68 passed, 2 ignored)
- Created `docs/feats/FEATURES_PTY.md` (7.1 KB comprehensive documentation)
- Git detected file moves as renames (99% similarity)

### Context Hash: e770fd3
### Files Modified: 10 (PTY files moved to pty/)

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Continue with next MOD4 task (if any) or move to next priority
2. Consider addressing unused function warning in keygen/helpers.rs
3. Update ROADMAP if MOD4 series is complete

### Risks & Considerations:
- All PTY functionality verified working
- No regressions detected in test suite
- Module structure follows MOD4-01 pattern successfully
