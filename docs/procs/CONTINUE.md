## HANDOFF-2025-10-01 (MOD4-01 Module Consolidation) ðŸš§

### Session Duration: ~2 hours
### Branch: main
### Phase: MOD4 MODULE_SPEC Refactor
### Completed: MOD4-01 (adp/ consolidation, 3 pts)

### Consolidation Details:
- Created `src/cage/adp/` module with `mod.rs`, `v1.rs`, `v2.rs`, `pipe.rs`
- Moved adapter files from their original locations
- Updated all imports across the codebase
- All tests passing (68 passed, 2 ignored)
- Created `docs/feats/FEATURES_ADP.md`

### Context Hash: 276f820
### Files Modified: 11 (adapters moved to adp/)

### Next Agent MUST:
1. Continue with MOD4-02 (pty/ consolidation, 3 pts)
2. Verify all tests still pass after adapter module move
3. Update references in documentation to reflect new module structure

### Risks & Considerations:
- Verify no unintended side effects in module restructuring
- Ensure all adapter-related functionality remains unchanged
- Double-check import paths in tests and example code
