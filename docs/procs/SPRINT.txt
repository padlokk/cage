## SPRINT NOTES
================================================================================

**Key Decisions**:
- Prioritize META_PROCESS v2 completion for better workflow foundation
- BUG-01 through BUG-05 take priority after META_PROCESS
- Consider TASK-010 (RSB migration) before remaining P1 work

**Blockers**:
- None currently

**Team Velocity**:
- Solo development with AI agent support
- Estimated 10-15 story points per week
