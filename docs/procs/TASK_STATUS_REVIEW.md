- Supports atomic rotation with backup and rollback
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

### CAGE-02: File Integrity Verification
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED
- Robust verification system implemented (lines 1084-1167 in `crud_manager.rs`)
- Supports multiple encryption formats
- Detailed error reporting and status tracking

### CAGE-03: Backup & Recovery Pipeline
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- Basic backup functionality via `BackupManager` (lines 84-233 in `crud_manager.rs`)
- Supports file backup and restoration
- Needs more comprehensive retention and conflict handling

### CAGE-04: In-Place Operation Safety
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED
- Implemented `SafetyValidator` and `InPlaceOperation` (lines 603-766 in `cli_age.rs`)
- Supports danger mode and recovery file creation
- Comprehensive safety checks before in-place operations

### CAGE-05: Progress & Telemetry
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETED
- Integrated progress management with multiple styles (lines 1175-1276 in `cli_age.rs`)
- Supports spinner, bar, byte, and counter progress indicators
- Respects verbosity flags

### CAGE-06: Configuration File Support
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- Configuration module exists but not fully implemented
- No comprehensive config loading or validation yet

### CAGE-07: RageAdapter Implementation
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- Basic adapter integration exists
- Needs more comprehensive `rage` crate integration

### CAGE-08: Multi-Recipient Encryption
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨ NOT STARTED
- No implementation of multiple recipient support
- Backlog item awaiting implementation

### CAGE-09: SSH Recipient Integration
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨ NOT STARTED
- No implementation of SSH key conversion
- Backlog item awaiting implementation

## Test & Tooling Improvements

### TEST-01: CLI Suite Updates
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- Current test scripts not updated
- Requires refresh of test scenarios

### TEST-02: Regression Coverage
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- Basic unit tests exist for core functionalities
- More targeted tests needed for specific bug fixes

### TEST-03: Proxy PTY Integration Tests
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- No cross-platform proxy tests implemented yet

## Infrastructure Tasks

### INFRA-01: PTY Module Migration
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- Migrated to Hub's `terminal-ext` feature
- Reduced dependency complexity

### INFRA-02: Progress Module Migration
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- Partially moved to RSB progress module
- Some local progress utilities still remain

## Recommendations
1. Complete configuration file support
2. Implement multi-recipient and SSH recipient features
3. Enhance test coverage, especially for CLI and edge cases
4. Finalize progress module migration
5. Add more comprehensive backup and retention strategies

## Summary
- ðŸŸ¢ Completed: 8 tasks
- ðŸŸ¡ Partially Completed: 5 tasks
- ðŸŸ¨ Needs Implementation: 5 tasks
