## Critical Implementation Gaps

### ❌ P0 - Blocking Production (Must Fix)

| Feature | Status | Location | Impact |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Key Rotation** | Stub Implementation | `src/cage/lifecycle/crud_manager.rs:196-224` | Core functionality missing |
| **File Verification** | Placeholder | `src/cage/lifecycle/crud_manager.rs:577-581` | Integrity checking absent |
| **Backup System** | Flag exists, no logic | Throughout codebase | Data safety risk |
| **Integration Tests** | Reference wrong project | `tests/` directory | No validation |
| **RageAdapter** | Not implemented | `src/cage/adapter.rs:117-157` | Alternative backend missing |

### ❌ P1 - High Priority (Critical for Usability)

**Core Functionality Gaps:**
- In-place encryption/decryption operations
- Large file streaming with progress indicators
- Parallel batch processing optimization
- File permission preservation during operations
- Symlink and special file handling
- Atomic operations with rollback capability

**User Experience Issues:**
- No interactive passphrase prompting (security risk)
- Missing progress feedback for long operations
- No configuration file support (`~/.cagerc`)
- Lack of dry-run mode for testing operations
- Limited error recovery guidance
